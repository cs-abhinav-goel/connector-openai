#### What's Improved
- Added a new configuration parameter `Verify SSL`, which when selected verifies the SSL certificate for the server. 
- Added support for Network Proxy. The API call to the OpenAI endpoint is routed using the network proxy if the proxy has been configured for the FortiSOAR instance.
